                <p class="review-description">I'm living with the same roommates as freshman year so that's great. I
                    have the master and its super big with its own bathroom, but my roomates have very small rooms and
                    share the common space bathroom which isn't as nice, and disproportionately priced because i only
                    pay $15 more a month for my own bathroom and huge room. I love the kitchen, its spacious with a lot
                    of storage. Every time we have a maintenance request its completed the same day. The living room
                    feels big for the small furniture, but at least it came furnished. The price is a little high at
                    $850 and I've never used the amenities which include a small gym, pool, and hot tub at the leasing
                    office. The bus routes are amazing and super close, I can walk out to it a minute before the bus
                    gets there.</p>

                <p class="review-description">Terrace View presents itself as a convenient off-campus housing option,
                    but beneath its facade lies a disheartening reality of neglect, mismanagement, and utter
                    disappointment. From deplorable living conditions to lackluster amenities and apathetic management,
                    Terrace View is a living nightmare for its unfortunate residents.

                    Let's start with the state of the apartments themselves. Upon moving in, residents are met with a
                    slew of issues ranging from pest infestations and mold growth to malfunctioning appliances and
                    plumbing problems. The units are poorly maintained, with outdated fixtures, dingy carpets, and a
                    pervasive odor that permeates every corner. Attempts to address these issues with management are met
                    with indifference or delayed responses, leaving residents to suffer in substandard living
                    conditions.

                    The amenities promised by Terrace View are nothing short of a cruel joke. The fitness center
                    resembles a dilapidated warehouse with broken equipment and a complete lack of cleanliness. The pool
                    area is a breeding ground for bacteria and algae, rendering it unusable for residents' seeking
                    relaxation or recreation. Common areas are often littered with trash and debris, reflecting the
                    overall neglect and disregard for residents' well-being.

                    Location-wise, Terrace View fails to provide the convenience and accessibility it claims to offer.
                    Situated in a less-than-desirable neighborhood plagued by crime and noise pollution, residents feel
                    unsafe and isolated in their surroundings. The lack of nearby amenities and entertainment options
                    further exacerbates feelings of frustration and disillusionment, leaving residents longing for a
                    sense of community and connection.

                    But perhaps the most egregious aspect of Terrace View is its management's blatant disregard for
                    residents' concerns and grievances. Requests for maintenance and repairs are routinely ignored or
                    dismissed, leaving residents to fend for themselves in the face of ongoing issues. Attempts to
                    communicate with management are met with unresponsiveness or excuses, leaving residents feeling
                    powerless and unheard in their own homes.

                    In summary, Terrace View Apartments is a cesspool of neglect and incompetence that should be avoided
                    at all costs. From its deplorable living conditions to its lackluster amenities and apathetic
                    management, Terrace View fails to provide the safe, comfortable, and welcoming living environment
                    that residents deserve. Save yourself the headache and heartache â€“ steer clear of Terrace View and
                    seek housing elsewhere.</p>
