                    disgusting and we had mold and my roommate was AWFUL. but then I got moved to the graduate life
                    center for the second semester because my roommate was that bad. So the GLC was great! It was a bit
                    lonely because no one on the hall opens their door and there were no events, but it was clean and I
                    didn't have to deal with that roommate anymore.</p>

                <p class="review-description">As a former resident of Virginia Tech's Slusher Hall, I feel compelled to
                    share my disappointing experience with future students considering this accommodation option. From
                    the moment I stepped foot into Slusher, I was met with disappointment and frustration.

                    Let's start with the facilities. Slusher is outdated and poorly maintained. The common areas are
                    dingy and unkempt, with worn-out furniture and outdated decor reminiscent of the 1970s. The
                    bathrooms are grimy and often plagued with plumbing issues, making basic hygiene a constant
                    challenge. Mold and mildew seem to have taken up permanent residence in the showers, creating an
                    unpleasant and unsanitary environment.

                    The rooms themselves are cramped and lackluster. The furniture is old and uncomfortable, with
                    mattresses that feel like they belong in a prison rather than a university dormitory. The lack of
                    adequate storage space means that clutter quickly accumulates, making it difficult to keep the room
                    clean and organized. The heating and cooling systems are unreliable, leaving residents sweltering in
                    the summer and freezing in the winter.

                    But perhaps the most egregious issue with Slusher is the noise. Thin walls and nonexistent
                    soundproofing mean that every cough, conversation, and late-night party can be heard loud and clear.
                    Trying to study or get a good night's sleep in such an environment is nearly impossible, leading to
                    increased stress and frustration for residents.

                    Overall, my experience living in Slusher was a complete disappointment. From the dismal facilities
                    to the lack of management oversight, it's clear that these dormitory falls far short of the
                    standards one would expect from a reputable university like Virginia Tech. I would strongly advise
                    any prospective students to look elsewhere for housing options, as Slusher is simply not worth the
                    headache and frustration.</p>
