                    but the room is too small for three. The beds have to be lofted with desks underneath in order for
                    it all to fit. I loved my roommates but if you didn't, you're screwed because there are only three
                    small common areas on each floor, no common bathroom, and only the central common room has a TV. The
                    kitchen are also only on every other floor. Overall it ended up fine for me, but it's so small i was
                    happy to get out.</p>

                <p class="review-description">New Hall West at Virginia Tech is nothing short of exceptional, offering
                    a living experience that exceeds all expectations. From its contemporary design to its abundance of
                    amenities, this dormitory sets a new standard for student accommodation.

                    Let's start with the facilities. New Hall West boasts modern architecture and state-of-the-art
                    amenities that rival those of luxury apartment complexes. The spacious common areas are thoughtfully
                    designed with comfortable furniture and stylish decor, creating inviting spaces for socializing,
                    studying, and relaxing. The bathrooms are kept immaculately clean, with modern fixtures and ample
                    shower facilities that ensure residents can maintain their hygiene without any hassle.

                    The rooms themselves are a dream come true for any college student. Unlike the cramped quarters
                    typical of many dormitories, the rooms in New Hall West are spacious and well-appointed, with plenty
                    of storage space and ergonomic furniture that promotes productivity and comfort. The beds are
                    outfitted with high-quality mattresses that guarantee a restful night's sleep, while the large
                    windows flood the rooms with natural light, creating a bright and airy atmosphere.

                    But what truly sets New Hall West apart is its commitment to fostering a sense of community and
                    belonging among its residents. The dorm hosts a variety of social events and activities throughout
                    the year, providing opportunities for students to connect with their peers and build lasting
                    friendships. The resident advisors are friendly and approachable, always willing to lend a helping
                    hand or provide support to those in need.

                    In addition to its outstanding facilities and community atmosphere, New Hall West offers
                    unparalleled convenience for its residents. Located in the heart of campus, the dorm is just steps
                    away from classrooms, dining halls, and recreational facilities, making it easy for students to
                    navigate their daily lives without the hassle of a lengthy commute.

                    Overall, my experience living in New Hall West has been nothing short of fantastic. From its modern
                    amenities to its vibrant community spirit, this dormitory has exceeded all of my expectations and
                    provided me with a home away from home during my time at Virginia Tech. I would highly recommend New
                    Hall West to any prospective students seeking a truly exceptional living experience.</p>
